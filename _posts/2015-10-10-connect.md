# Connect

Data is an essential part of the modern business world. It's a resource that's every bit as valuable to today's businesses as fossil fuels were to the businesses of the past.

Unfortunately, if your IT infrastructure depends on cobbling together disparate systems, you may not be able to capture data effectively, analyze it quickly, and use it to support better business decision making. Soono's custom applications, utilities and add-ons can help connect all of your systems together. As a result, you'll have a single well-oiled data management machine, which can enable you to become a data-driven business.
